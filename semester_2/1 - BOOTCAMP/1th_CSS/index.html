    <p>
      There are many <del>variations</del> of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,
      <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
      and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
      but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected
      humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If
      you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there
      isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. 
      <p>All the <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
      necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a
      dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
      sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The
      generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected
      humour, or non-characteristic words etc. H<sub>2</sub>O, 5<sup>2</sup>

      "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna
      aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis

    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
    from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
    looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
    the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
    of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise
    on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
    amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and
    1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by
    English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p></p>
