    <p>
      There are many <del>variations</del> of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,
      <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
      but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected
      humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If
      you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there
      isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem
      Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
      necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a
      dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
      sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The
      generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected
      humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
