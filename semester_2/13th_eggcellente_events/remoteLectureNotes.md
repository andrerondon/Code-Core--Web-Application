# ORMS

What are ORMS

- Stands for Object Relational Mapping / Object Relation Mapper
- Layer between the Database & SQL and your Business logic

Why use ORMs

- A lot of built in functionality such as queries that you don't need to write
- Makes it easy to validate inputs by providing built in functionality for that
- Makes it easy to relate models to each other
