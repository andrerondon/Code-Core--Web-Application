# require('pry') # a gem that allows us to use a ruby REPL

# We can define a class using the `class` keyword

# classes are a core part of the ruby language
# they're blueprints for creating objects
# We define a class using the `class` keyword
# by convention the name of classes are CamelCase
# It's best practice to only have one class per file.
class Cookie
  # defining a global variable you use the $ symbol
  # global variables are accessible anywhere
  $greeting = 'Hello World'

  attr_reader :flour # this method creates the @flour instance variable and adds the getter automatically
  attr_writer :flour # creates the setter

  # attr_accessor :sugar # creates the @sugar instance variable and both the getter and setter methods.

  # class method
  # class methods can be called on the Class itself.
  # trying to call a class method through in a instance will return an error
  # we can define a class method by creating a method prepended with self.
